# Go API Lambda for swagger

A simple distributed job scheduler running on top of AWS

## Overview
These Lambdas was generated by the [swagger-codegen]
(https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a lambda stub.
